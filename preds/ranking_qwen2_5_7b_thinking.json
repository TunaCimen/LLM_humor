It suggests that the situation depicted in the image (a large mechanical arm holding a person high above a crowd) is being presented in a way that makes it seem less scary or dangerous.\n   - The humor here is subtle and relies on the double meaning of \"sugarcoat,\" which might not be immediately obvious to everyone.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"Would you believe a kid came up with this?\"**\n   - This caption implies that the idea behind the image is so absurd or outlandish that even a child could come up with it. The humor here is more direct and relies on the absurdity of the situation itself rather than a wordplay.\n   - The image shows a large mechanical arm holding a person high above a crowd, which is an unusual and potentially dangerous scenario. The caption suggests that such a scenario is so improbable that only a child would think of it.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- **Caption A** requires the audience to understand the wordplay and connect it to the image, which might not be as universally funny.\n- **Caption B** directly points out the absurdity of the situation without needing any wordplay, making it more straightforward and likely to be appreciated by a broader audience.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is B: \"Would you believe a kid came up with this??\"\n</answer>",

The wordplay \"on beat\" is a pun that plays on the idea of rhythm and effort, making it more humorous.\n   - The caption ties into the visual gag effectively, adding a layer of humor through the double meaning of \"on beat.\"\n\nGiven these points, the second caption uses a clever wordplay and directly relates to the visual humor in the cartoon, making it more engaging and funny.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nB) It's like you're not even trying to shovel on beat.\n</answer>",

Why do you ask?\"\n   - This caption directly addresses the situation shown in the image, where a person is lying on a couch, possibly feeling distressed or overwhelmed. The reference to feeling like a victim after a divorce adds a relatable and humorous touch, as it suggests that the person might be experiencing feelings of helplessness or victimhood, which is a common reaction during or after a divorce.\n   - The use of \"Why do you ask?\" implies a playful interaction, making the caption feel more engaging and conversational.\n\n2. **Caption B**: \"Unfortunately, your time is up, but I think we have a general outline of your problem.\"\n   - This caption seems to be a professional response, possibly from a therapist or counselor, indicating that the session is ending and they have identified some issues. While it is informative and somewhat serious, it lacks the humor and relatability of the first caption.\n   - The phrase \"your time is up\" is a bit abrupt and doesn't add much humor compared to the conversational tone of the first caption.\n\nConsidering these points, the first caption is more likely to be considered funnier because it uses humor and relatability effectively, while the second caption feels more formal and less engaging.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is A: \"Why yes, it's quite common to feel like a victim after a divorce.

The cartoon shows a pyramid with a person at the top enjoying a leisurely life, which could be seen as extravagant or impractical compared to typical lottery spending habits.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"He offered us a franchise, but I think it's a pyramid scheme.\"**\n   - This caption directly references the pyramid structure in the cartoon and implies that the pyramid represents a pyramid scheme, a common financial scam where participants pay money to join and earn commissions on recruiting new members. The humor here comes from the irony that the pyramid is not just a visual representation but also a metaphor for a fraudulent business model.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- Caption A is more straightforward and doesn't make a direct connection to the pyramid structure.\n- Caption B cleverly uses the visual metaphor of the pyramid to suggest a humorous and ironic situation, making it more engaging and funny.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is B: \"He offered us a franchise, but I think it's a pyramid scheme.\"\n</answer>",

They were at that rally too.\"**\n   - This caption plays on the idea of the Joneses being a well-known family or group, often used humorously to refer to an average or typical family. The mention of a rally adds a layer of absurdity, suggesting that the Joneses are somehow connected to a political event, which is unexpected and humorous.\n   \n2. **Caption B: \"Grammatically, indeed it IS sleep with the fish, not 'fishes'.\"**\n   - This caption references a grammatical error but does not directly relate to the visual content of the cartoon. It's a bit of a pun, but it doesn't have the same immediate visual or situational humor as the first caption.\n\nGiven the visual context of the cartoon, where two people are literally tied to buckets, the caption that ties into this visual gag would be more effective. Caption A does this by using the Joneses as a familiar reference point and then adding the unexpected element of a rally, which contrasts with the mundane setting of the cartoon.\n\nTherefore, the funnier caption is:\n</think>\n<answer>A: \"Have you met the Joneses?

No, we haven't had any substantiated reports of earthquakes.\"\n   - This caption is humorous because it plays on the absurdity of FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) being called to handle an earthquake when there are no reports of such an event. It's a joke about overreacting or misinterpreting a situation.\n\n2. **Caption B**: \"Thirty percent on car insurance is great but I'm a little busy right now.\"\n   - This caption is less humorous and more mundane. It's a statement about the cost of car insurance and someone's current inability to deal with it. There's no unexpected twist or absurdity that would make this a funny caption.\n\nGiven these analyses, the first caption is clearly more humorous due to its unexpected and absurd nature.\n\n<think> The first caption is funnier because it involves a play on the absurdity of FEMA being called for an earthquake when there are no reports of such an event, which is a humorous exaggeration.

The mention of \"smoke\" as decoration adds to the absurdity and humor.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"I don't make the laws of physics, sir.

It's a more serious and less humorous take on the situation, focusing more on the role of the police officer rather than the absurdity of the scenario.\n\nGiven these analyses, the first caption introduces an unexpected and humorous element by suggesting the airplane is electric and the smoke is decorative, which aligns well with the absurdity of the cartoon.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is A: \"No, it's electric, sir.

It implies a serious tone and might not be as humorous as it could be.\n\n- Caption B: \"We're in trouble... they spotted my Kindle?\"\n  - This caption introduces a humorous element by suggesting that the Kindle (a modern e-reader) is being mistaken for a book. The phrase \"we're in trouble\" adds a playful twist, implying that the Kindle is somehow causing a commotion or misunderstanding among the book characters.\n\nGiven the context of the cartoon, where the Kindle seems to be the cause of the commotion, the second caption aligns better with the visual humor of the image.

It's functional and doesn't add much to the humor beyond the basic premise of the cartoon.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"Security is a breeze - no more strip searches.\"**\n   - This caption introduces an absurd and unexpected twist. The idea of security being so easy that it eliminates the need for strip searches is a humorous exaggeration. It plays on the absurdity of the situation, which is often what makes cartoons funny.

The phrase \"paint yourself into a corner\" is a common idiom meaning to put oneself in a difficult situation.\n   - The caption directly relates to the visual elements of the image and uses a well-known idiom, making it more likely to be understood as a joke.\n\nGiven these points, the second caption is more directly related to the visual content and uses an idiomatic expression that adds a layer of humor.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is B: \"During next week's session, we'll have you paint yourself into a corner.\"\n</answer>",

The humor here comes from the absurdity of the size and the implication that even a sculptor would struggle to capture his true form.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"Can you tell it's a knockoff?\"**\n   - This caption implies that the man in the cartoon is a copy or imitation of something else, possibly suggesting that he is not original or authentic. The humor here could be derived from the idea that the man looks so out of place or is so exaggerated that he seems like a fake or a parody.\n\nConsidering the visual context of the cartoon, where the man is disproportionately large compared to the furniture and the people around him, the first caption \"All he needs now is a Greek sculptor\" aligns better with the exaggerated nature of the figure. It plays on the idea of needing a sculptor to handle such an oversized figure, which is a humorous exaggeration of the situation depicted.\n\nOn the other hand, while the second caption also uses humor, it doesn't directly relate to the exaggerated size of the man but rather to the idea of being a copy or knockoff, which might not be as immediately clear or relatable in this specific context.\n\nTherefore, the first caption is more directly related to the visual humor of the cartoon.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is A: \"All he needs now is a Greek sculptor.\"\n</answer>",

The tone is matter-of-fact and doesn't add much humor.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"Looks like you woke up on the wrong side of the cone.\"**\n   - This caption is more playful and humorous. It uses a common phrase, \"woke up on the wrong side of the bed,\" which is often used to describe a bad mood or a difficult morning. By replacing \"bed\" with \"cone,\" it adds a visual and situational twist that aligns well with the image of the dog wearing a cone.

This adds an element of humor and surprise, as it plays on the unexpected setting (space) and the passenger's reaction.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"This way we avoid the turnpike.\"**\n   - The caption \"This way we avoid the turnpike\" is more straightforward and literal. It suggests that the car is taking a route to bypass a turnpike, which is a common road feature. While this might be a practical comment, it lacks the whimsical and unexpected twist that makes a caption funny.\n\nGiven these analyses, the first caption, \"Is he still back there?\", introduces an element of surprise and humor by playing on the unusual setting and the passenger's reaction, making it more likely to be considered funnier by most people.\n</think>\n<answer>\nA) Is he still back there?\n</answer>",

The juxtaposition of a dinosaur, which is not typically associated with book signings, with the act of signing books creates a funny and unexpected scenario.\n   - The use of \"physical\" in the caption adds another layer of humor, suggesting that the dinosaur might be a literal, three-dimensional creature rather than just a costume.\n\nGiven these analyses, the second caption (B) is more directly related to the cartoon's content and adds a layer of absurdity that enhances its humor.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is B: \"You're doing physical book signings, and I'm the dinosaur.\"\n</answer>",

The phrase \"going as\" suggests a costume or disguise, but the comparison to a satellite dish is not immediately clear and doesn't align well with the visual gag of the dog turning inside out.\n   - The humor here is less direct and more abstract, relying on a wordplay that might not be as immediately apparent to viewers.\n\nConsidering these points, Caption A is more directly related to the visual gag and uses the expected reaction (barking) to create a humorous effect. Caption B, while playful, introduces an unrelated concept that doesn't enhance the visual humor as effectively.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is A: \"If you bark loud enough, it turns inside-out.\"\n</answer>",

The image shows a guillotine, which is not typically associated with comic book sounds. However, the caption could be seen as a playful way to suggest that the person using the guillotine should be more serious about their actions.\n   - The humor here is somewhat ironic because the guillotine is a serious historical instrument of execution, and the \"KAPOW!\" sound is usually associated with light-hearted or humorous contexts.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"Would you like that gift-wrapped?\"**\n   - This caption is a play on the idea of wrapping something, but in this case, it's applied to the guillotine. The guillotine is not something that would typically be wrapped, so this caption is absurd and humorous.\n   - The humor here is more straightforward and absurd, as it takes an everyday concept (wrapping a gift) and applies it to an object that is completely unrelated (a guillotine).\n\nConsidering these points, the second caption, \"Would you like that gift-wrapped?\", is more straightforwardly absurd and therefore potentially funnier due to its unexpected and humorous nature.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is B: \"Would you like that gift-wrapped?\"\n</answer>",

The idea of \"seating the new species\" adds a humorous twist, suggesting that these creatures are being considered for inclusion in some sort of human-like society or organization.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"Dr. Smith here will explain what went wrong with the clinical trial.\"**\n   - This caption introduces a human character (Dr. Smith) and implies that there has been a failure in a clinical trial. While it could be seen as a serious statement about scientific research gone wrong, it lacks the whimsical and absurd humor present in the cartoon. The presence of the human figure and the mention of a clinical trial might not align well with the cartoon's tone of absurdity and fantasy.\n\nGiven the context of the cartoon, which features a surreal and humorous scene, the first caption fits better with the overall tone and adds an element of absurdity that enhances the humor.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is A: \"I'll entertain a motion to seat the new species at the table.\"\n</answer>",

The caption lacks the punchline or the unexpected twist that would make it funny.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"Just for fun, let's send it back.\"**\n   - This caption adds an element of absurdity and humor. The waiter is carrying a pizza through a crowd of people, which is already an unusual and humorous scenario. The caption suggests that the couple is so amused by this situation that they want to send the pizza back, adding a layer of irony and exaggeration. This caption plays on the idea of the absurdity of the situation and the couple's reaction to it, making it more engaging and humorous.\n\nGiven these considerations, the second caption is more likely to be considered funnier because it leverages the absurdity of the situation and adds a humorous twist.\n</think>\n<answer>\nB) Just for fun, let's send it back.\n</answer>",

It humorously suggests that they have been around for a while and are therefore \"experienced\" in something, likely related to their environment or behavior.\n   - The humor here comes from the anthropomorphization of the praying mantises and the play on words (\"experienced\" could mean both having a lot of experience and being well-built).\n\n2. **Caption B: \"I'll never go back to that barber shop.\"**\n   - This caption implies that the praying mantises are at a barber shop, which is not a typical place for insects.

The phrase \"at the dip\" likely refers to the moment when the matador dips his sword or hand towards the bull, a common move in bullfighting. The humor here comes from the unexpected twist that the bull is actually the one performing this action, which is a reversal of the usual roles. It's a clever play on words and expectations.\n\n2. **Option B: \"I'm also a licensed massage therapist.\"**\n   - This caption is more straightforward and doesn't directly relate to the image.

The caption suggests that this is an outdated or unusual way to wear a cone, which adds to the humor by implying that the dog is being creative or rebellious.\n  - The use of \"Dad\" also adds a personal touch, making it relatable and funny for many people who have pets and have seen similar situations.\n\nGiven these points, the second caption is more aligned with the humor of the cartoon and is therefore likely to be considered funnier by most people.\n</think>\n<answer>\nB) No one wears their cone like that anymore Dad?\n</answer>",

The humor here could stem from the absurdity of the situation, as it's highly unlikely that someone would be conducting such an experiment in a therapy session.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- Caption A relies on the unexpectedness of ending a therapy session, which can be humorous but is somewhat situational.\n- Caption B introduces a completely absurd scenario (a scientific experiment during a therapy session), which is more universally funny due to its unexpected and nonsensical nature.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is B: \"He's in the control group?\" because it introduces an absurd and nonsensical scenario that is universally humorous.\n</answer>",

The humor comes from the unexpected and somewhat absurd situation where a car repair shop would be concerned about non-OEM parts when the car is already heavily modified with clown-themed decorations.\n   - The caption is clever and fits well with the visual gag of a car being transformed into a clown-mobile.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"On your way to the Republican National Convention, I see.\"**\n   - This caption seems out of place in the context of the cartoon. The image does not depict any political event or convention. The caption introduces an unrelated topic that does not align with the visual elements of the cartoon.\n   - While it might be a humorous attempt at a joke, it doesn't fit the scene and therefore lacks the same level of relevance and impact as the first caption.\n\nGiven this analysis, the first caption is more appropriate and funnier because it directly relates to the visual elements of the cartoon and provides a clever twist on the situation presented.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is A: \"You seem to have one non Original Equipment Manufacturer part.\"\n</answer>",

In the cartoon, it could be interpreted as the person on the left is trying to maintain their own space or life while the other two are sitting together. The humor might come from the contrast between the person's attempt at independence and the casual interaction of the others.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"Notice, how form follows function.\"**\n   - This is a play on the famous architectural principle \"form follows function,\" which means that the design of something should be determined by its purpose. Here, the caption is suggesting that the person's posture (standing and pointing) is not aligned with the function of the room (sitting and relaxing). The humor here is more subtle and might require the viewer to understand the architectural reference to appreciate the joke fully.\n\nConsidering the simplicity and directness of the first caption, it might be more universally relatable and easier to understand for viewers who may not be familiar with the architectural principle mentioned in the second caption.

It's a common and relatable situation.\n   - The humor here might come from the absurdity of an elephant needing a password, which is unexpected and humorous due to the contrast between the animal and the human activity.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"I love how His recent work has become more abstract?\"**\n   - This caption is a statement about art or creative work. It suggests that the person is appreciating the artist's recent work, which has become more abstract.\n   - While this could be funny if it's a joke about someone who doesn't understand abstract art, the context provided in the image does not suggest any connection to abstract art. Therefore, this caption might not be as directly related to the image and its humor.\n\nGiven the image, the humor is centered around the unexpected situation of an elephant using a laptop, which is a playful and absurd scenario.

The phrase \"So sue me\" could imply that the person is acknowledging their involvement in the mess but also suggesting that they shouldn't face consequences.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"Too late?\"**\n   - This phrase suggests a sense of urgency or realization that something has already happened and cannot be undone.\n   - In the context of the cartoon, the person on the right seems to be in the process of cleaning up a mess, while the other person looks distressed.

The humor here comes from the unexpected nature of the question and the implication that the action was not well-received.\n\nBoth captions are funny, but they appeal to different aspects of humor:\n- Caption A uses exaggeration and absurdity.\n- Caption B uses irony and social awkwardness.\n\nGiven these points, both are effective in their own way, but the choice of which is funnier can depend on personal preference. However, if we consider the broader context of the cartoon, which seems to be about a formal event (possibly a dinner or a meeting), the social aspect might resonate more with the audience.\n\nTherefore, the funnier caption could be considered as the one that aligns better with the social dynamics depicted in the cartoon.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is B: \"Did giving the centerpieces away before dinner send the wrong signal?\"\n</answer>",

The caption plays on the idea of infidelity, which can be humorous but also serious depending on the audience's perspective.\n\n2. **Option B: \"I guess it really did kill you to call.\"**\n   - This caption implies that the man's death was so painful that it caused him to call, which is a dark and morbid joke. It plays on the idea of the man's death being so impactful that it made him want to communicate before he passed away. This is a more explicit and darker humor that might appeal to those who enjoy dark comedy.\n\nConsidering the tone and the visual elements of the cartoon, Option B seems to be more aligned with the dark humor often found in New Yorker cartoons.

The setting in the cartoon shows a group of people sitting at tables, possibly in a restaurant or café, and a person climbing a cliff. The caption could imply that the person climbing the cliff has set an unrealistic goal for themselves.\n   - The humor here might come from the contrast between the seemingly mundane activities of the people at the tables and the extreme physical challenge of the climber. It plays on the idea of setting unrealistic goals.\n\n2. **Option B: \"My son, we all have reservations.\"**\n   - This caption is a play on words. \"Reservations\" can mean either a place to sit at a table (as in a restaurant) or a pre-arranged commitment. In this context, it seems to be a reference to the tables where the people are sitting, but it also implies a humorous misunderstanding about the climber's intentions.\n   - The humor here comes from the double meaning of \"reservations,\" suggesting that the climber might be making a reservation somewhere, which is a playful and unexpected twist.\n\nConsidering both options, Option B uses a clever wordplay that adds an element of surprise and humor, making it more engaging and funny than the straightforward suggestion in Option A.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nOption B: \"My son, we all have reservations.\"\n</answer>",

The caption humorously suggests that the person cooking the large turkey is the one who wanted to buy something big, likely referencing Costco.\n   - The humor comes from the unexpected connection between the size of the turkey and the idea of joining Costco, which is a place where one might buy large quantities of items.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"I don't tell you how to gather.\"**\n   - This caption is a reference to the phrase \"don't tell me how to do my job,\" which is often used when someone is being told how to perform a task they are already familiar with or responsible for.\n   - In this context, it could be interpreted as the person cooking the turkey saying they don't need instructions on how to cook a turkey, which is a common and straightforward task.\n\nComparing the two:\n- Caption A uses a clever wordplay and an unexpected connection (the size of the turkey and Costco), making it more humorous and creative.\n- Caption B is a straightforward statement that, while it might be funny in some contexts, doesn't have the same level of creativity or unexpected twist as Caption A.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, Caption A is likely to be considered funnier by most people.\n</think>\n<answer>\nA) You're the one who wanted to join Costco.\n</answer>",

The implication is that the washing machine is consuming too much water, which could be seen as a humorous exaggeration given the arid background and the presence of a bucket, suggesting a lack of water resources.

The phrase \"give 'em hell\" adds an element of defiance or strong emotion, which can be seen as funny in this context.\n   \n2. **Option B: \"I had some suitcase issues at the airport.\"**\n   - This caption is a straightforward statement about having problems with luggage at an airport.

The cartoon shows people walking outside, which could be interpreted as a relief or a return to normalcy after being stuck inside.\n   - The humor here might come from the irony of being \"stuck inside\" being a distant memory, but it doesn't directly relate to the visual gag of the cartoon.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"It's only awkward when I have to use a public restroom.\"**\n   - This caption focuses on the awkwardness of using a public restroom, which is a common social anxiety.

It's a humorous take on the typical interaction between a performer and an audience, but it doesn't directly relate to the visual gag of the fish swimming in the piano.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"No one can sing 'Cry me a river' like he does.\"**\n   - This caption references the song \"Cry Me a River,\" which is famously associated with the character Kramer from the TV show \"Seinfeld.\" The caption implies that the pianist is so good at playing this song that it makes the audience feel emotional, as if they were watching a scene from the show where Kramer sings this song. This is a clever reference that ties into the visual gag of the fish, suggesting that the music is so evocative that it creates a surreal, almost aquatic atmosphere.\n\nGiven these analyses, the second caption (B) is more likely to be considered funnier because it not only plays on the visual gag but also references a popular cultural moment, making it more engaging and relatable to a wider audience.\n</think>\n<answer>\nB) No one can sing 'Cry me a river' like he does.\n</answer>",

What did you say after ‘I've been shot’?\"**\n   - This caption plays on the idea of someone falling asleep during a serious conversation about being shot. The humor comes from the juxtaposition of the casual tone (\"Sorry, I drifted off there\") with the serious and dramatic statement (\"What did you say after ‘I've been shot’?\"). It creates an unexpected and amusing contrast.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"I never should have given Julia that chalk for her birthday.\"**\n   - This caption seems to be a mundane statement about a gift gone wrong. There's no clear connection to the image or any dramatic situation. While it might be slightly humorous due to the awkwardness of the situation, it lacks the same level of unexpectedness and dramatic irony as the first caption.\n\nGiven this analysis, the first caption (A) is more likely to be considered funnier because it creates a humorous and ironic situation that aligns well with the image of someone lying on a couch, possibly asleep, while another person sits in a chair reading a book.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is A: \"Sorry, I drifted off there.

The humor here might be subtle and could be interpreted as a commentary on the lack of modern conveniences in prehistoric times.\n   - The punchline \"until they discovered fire\" adds an unexpected twist, implying that the scene would be more interesting if it were set in a more advanced time period.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"They're always fighting about who gets to ride shotgun.\"**\n   - This caption directly references the image where multiple figures appear to be preparing to hunt mammoths. The phrase \"who gets to ride shotgun\" is a colloquial expression used to describe someone getting the best seat in a car, often implying a position of privilege or importance.\n   - In this context, the caption humorously suggests that the hunters are so focused on their roles that they are arguing over the most prestigious position, which is comical given the serious nature of the hunt.\n\nConsidering the visual elements and the tone of the captions:\n- Caption A is more philosophical and less immediately humorous.\n- Caption B is more direct and uses a relatable, everyday expression to create a humorous contrast with the serious activity of hunting.\n\nGiven these points, the second caption is likely to be considered funnier by most people because it leverages a common, relatable scenario to create a humorous juxtaposition with the serious activity depicted in the image.\n</think>\n<answer>\nB) They're always fighting about who gets to ride shotgun.\n</answer>",

The phrase \"same audition\" implies a shared experience, which could be humorous if the parrots are indeed in a setting where they are being judged.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"We have to stop eating the seed money.\"**\n   - This caption introduces a different scenario. \"Seed money\" typically refers to an initial investment or funds used to start something. If the parrots are eating this seed money, it implies they are consuming resources meant for starting something new, which could be seen as wasteful and humorous.\n\nGiven the visual context of the cartoon, where the parrots appear to be in a room with framed pictures on the wall, it seems more likely that they are in a setting where they are being observed or judged, such as an art gallery or a similar environment. Therefore, the first caption fits better with the visual context.\n\nHowever, the second caption introduces a different and unexpected twist by suggesting the parrots are eating seed money, which can be seen as a humorous and absurd situation.\n\nConsidering both elements, the second caption adds a layer of absurdity and humor that isn't immediately apparent in the first caption.

Passive-aggressive behavior involves indirect ways of expressing displeasure or anger, often through procrastination or indirect actions.\n   - The image shows a man using a hose to clean up a mess, but the mess appears to be caused by a broken appliance (a toaster), and he seems to be doing it reluctantly. This could indeed be interpreted as passive-aggressive behavior, as he is not directly addressing the source of the problem (the broken toaster).\n\n2. **Option B: \"It's a classic 1980 Sunbeam.\"**\n   - This caption refers to the toaster in the image, specifically identifying it as a \"Sunbeam\" model, which was a popular brand of toasters in the 1980s.\n   - While this caption provides factual information about the toaster, it does not add any humor or context to the image. It simply identifies the object without any playful or ironic undertone.\n\nGiven these analyses, the first caption, \"Too passive-aggressive?\", adds a layer of humor by suggesting a deeper, more relatable human emotion (passive-aggressive behavior) to the seemingly mundane task of cleaning up a mess. This makes the caption more engaging and funny compared to the straightforward identification of the toaster.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is A: \"Too passive-aggressive?\" because it adds a humorous and relatable interpretation to the image, making it more engaging and amusing for viewers.\n</answer>",

However, the cartoon depicts a chaotic scene with a person running away from a desk that has fallen over, and there are no visible paperweights or any indication of an office environment.

The person appears to be in a state of panic, possibly due to the falling desk and scattered papers, which could be caused by an overheated room. The caption humorously suggests that the person is trying to stop something (likely the falling desk) by telling someone to turn the air down, which is a common way to cool down a room.

The caption suggests that the patient might be in pain or discomfort due to the arrows, implying he could try a different position for relief.

The setting suggests a primitive time before modern amenities.\n\n2. Caption A: \"Before we got fire, we used to talk to each other.\"\n   - This caption is a play on words. It humorously contrasts the cavemen's current activity (juggling) with their past (talking). The joke lies in the absurdity of the idea that before fire, they would have been talking instead of using fire for various purposes.\n\n3. Caption B: \"Well, I think he's nailed the talent portion.\"\n   - This caption is also humorous but in a different way. It implies that the caveman has successfully demonstrated his juggling skills, which is a talent. However, it's a bit more straightforward and less of a pun compared to the first caption.\n\nConsidering the humor in wordplay and the unexpected twist, Caption A is more playful and cleverly uses the concept of fire to create a humorous contrast. Therefore, it is likely to be considered funnier by most people.\n</think>\n<answer>\nA) Before we got fire, we used to talk to each other.\n</answer>",

It directly addresses the reason for the police pullover, which is the plane crash.\n   - While it might be a factual statement, it lacks the whimsical and exaggerated humor present in Caption A.\n\nGiven these analyses, the first caption, \"I'd guess you have really, really small hands?\", is more likely to be considered funnier because it adds an element of absurdity and exaggeration that aligns well with the cartoon's tone and the unexpected nature of the scene.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is A: \"I'd guess you have really, really small hands?\"\n</answer>",

The phrase \"mean business\" implies that the group is taking their responsibilities or intentions very seriously, possibly in a threatening or authoritative manner. The cartoon shows a group of people being led by figures on horseback, one of whom is holding a large spear, which could be interpreted as a symbol of authority or power. This aligns well with the caption, suggesting a sense of seriousness and determination.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"In hindsight it was an uneven merger.\"**\n   - This caption uses the phrase \"in hindsight,\" which typically refers to looking back at a situation after it has occurred. The term \"uneven merger\" suggests that something went wrong in a business transaction, implying that the outcome was not favorable. The cartoon, however, does not depict a business setting but rather a scene that looks more like a historical or medieval reenactment. The caption seems out of place in this context because there is no indication of a business merger or any modern business-related activity.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- Caption A fits the context of the cartoon better, as it aligns with the serious and authoritative tone suggested by the imagery.\n- Caption B is humorous but misplaced in the context of the cartoon, as it references a business scenario that is not present in the image.\n\nTherefore, the funnier caption is likely the one that best fits the context and tone of the image.\n</think>\n<answer>\nA) This time they'll know we mean business.\n</answer>",

It's a common phrase used in human interactions and doesn't have any unexpected or humorous elements.\n\n- Option B: \"Why not Quebec??\"\n  - This caption introduces an element of surprise and humor. The phrase \"Why not Quebec?\" is a play on words. \"Quebec\" sounds similar to \"quick,\" and the question implies that the parrots could speak quickly if they wanted to. This unexpected twist makes the caption more amusing and likely to elicit laughter from viewers.\n\nGiven this analysis, the caption that introduces an unexpected and humorous element is more likely to be considered funnier.\n</think>\n<answer>\nB) Why not Quebec?\n</answer>",

It doesn't add any humor or context to the situation depicted in the image. The image shows an airplane on the side of a road, and a police car nearby, suggesting some kind of incident. This caption doesn't provide any insight into why the airplane might be there or what the police car is doing.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"Well, five acres of popcorn back there says you were.\"**\n   - This caption is more playful and adds a humorous element. The phrase \"five acres of popcorn\" is a reference to the size of the field where the airplane has landed, implying that it has taken up a significant amount of space. The use of \"you were\" suggests that the airplane was indeed responsible for the landing, adding a layer of irony and humor to the situation.

The humor here might come from the ambiguity and the idea of meeting different types of men, but it doesn't directly relate to the visual elements of the cartoon.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"Dr. Phil was right about you.\"**\n   - This caption references a well-known television personality known for his talk show that often deals with personal issues and relationships.

The humor here comes from the unexpected twist that the character (a bird) is actually singing this famous line, which is not typical for a bird.\n   - The juxtaposition of the quote with the image creates a humorous contrast because it's not common for birds to sing such a human-centric phrase.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"Remember when he was just a humming bird???\"**\n   - This caption directly addresses the bird in the nest. It suggests a transformation or a memory of the bird being smaller, specifically a hummingbird. The humor here is based on the idea of remembering a past state of the bird, which is a playful and whimsical notion.\n   - The use of the question mark and the repetition of \"Remember\" adds a sense of nostalgia and curiosity, which can be amusing.\n\nConsidering both captions, the second one, \"Remember when he was just a humming bird???\", is more directly related to the visual elements of the cartoon. It plays on the idea of the bird's size and its past, which is visually represented by the small branch it's perched on. The first caption, while clever, is less directly tied to the image and relies more on the cultural reference rather than the visual elements.\n\nTherefore, the second caption is more directly humorous and tied to the visual elements of the cartoon.\n</think>\n<answer>\nB) Remember when he was just a humming bird??\n</answer>",

While it might be true, it doesn't add any humor to the image.\n\n2. **Option B: \"It's a Furrari.\"**\n   - This caption is a play on words. \"Furrari\" is a pun combining \"Ferrari,\" a high-performance car brand, with \"furry,\" which refers to the cat in the image.

The phrase \"hollow inside\" could imply that the head is not filled with a real person but rather an empty space, which adds a humorous twist to the scene. It suggests a playful and somewhat absurd scenario where the head is not a real person but rather a representation of someone who is no longer there.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"He never liked photographs.\"**\n   - This caption is more straightforward and doesn't directly relate to the visual elements of the cartoon. It makes a general statement about the person whose head is in the cemetery, which might not be as immediately funny as the first caption. The humor here would rely more on the implication that the person was not fond of being photographed, which is a common theme but less visually engaging than the first caption.\n\nGiven these analyses, the first caption, \"If I knew Larry, its hollow inside,\" is more likely to be considered funnier because it directly relates to the visual gag of the large head in the cemetery and adds a layer of absurdity that enhances the humor.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is A: \"If I knew Larry, its hollow inside.\"\n</answer>",

The phrase \"taking the heat\" is a common idiom meaning to be blamed or criticized for something. The cloud figure, with its exaggerated features and the way it's holding the tablets, seems to be in a position of authority or responsibility, which aligns well with the idiom. The humor comes from the unexpected personification of the cloud and the implication that it's being held accountable for something.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"Stop me if you've heard these before.\"**\n   - This caption is a play on the phrase \"Stop me if you've heard this before,\" which is often used when telling a story to see if someone has already heard it.

It feels out of place and doesn't connect well with the visual elements of the cartoon.\n\nGiven the analysis, the first caption, \"You think I'm taking the heat for this?\", is more fitting and humorous because it directly relates to the visual metaphor of the cloud figure being held responsible, which is a clever and unexpected twist.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is A: \"You think I'm taking the heat for this?\"\n</answer>",

However, it doesn't directly relate to the visual elements of the cartoon, such as the tiger and the office setting.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"It was worse with the lion.\"**\n   - This caption directly references the visual element of the cartoon where there is a tiger on top of a desk, which is a more serious and potentially dangerous situation than what is implied by the caption. The use of \"worse\" suggests that the presence of a lion would be even more problematic than the tiger, adding a layer of absurdity and exaggeration that can be humorous.\n\nGiven these points, the second caption uses the visual metaphor effectively to create a humorous contrast between the tiger and a lion, which is a more exaggerated and therefore potentially funnier scenario.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is B: \"It was worse with the lion.\"\n</answer>",

The humor here is based on the relatability of struggling with complex subjects and the self-deprecating tone.\n   - The humor is more straightforward and universally understood as it touches on a common experience many people can relate to.\n\nGiven these considerations, the second caption (B) is likely to be perceived as funnier because it directly addresses a relatable and humorous situation that most people can identify with, whereas the first caption, while clever, might require more context to fully appreciate its humor.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is B: \"I never did understand calculus.\"\n</answer>",

In the image, there is a character dressed as a Viking, and the caption humorously suggests that the bride might be calling her groom a \"Hun\" because he looks like a Viking.\n   - The humor here comes from the unexpected and somewhat crude comparison, which is a common source of amusement in cartoons.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"The third usher fell out of the boat?\"**\n   - This caption seems out of place in the context of the image. The image depicts a wedding scene with a Viking character, and there is no indication of a boat or an usher falling out of it. This caption does not align with the visual elements of the image and lacks the context to be funny.\n\nGiven this analysis, the first caption, \"Now I know why she calls him Hun,\" is more appropriate and humorous because it directly relates to the visual elements of the image (the Viking character) and uses a play on words that is likely to elicit a chuckle from viewers familiar with the term \"Hun.\"\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is A: \"Now I know why she calls him Hun.\"\n</answer>",

The phrase \"good attorney\" humorously contrasts with the situation, as an attorney typically helps free someone from such bindings. However, this caption might not directly relate to the visual gag in the cartoon.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"So when are you two taking the plunge?\"**\n   - This caption plays on the visual gag where the individuals appear to be tied up and suggests a metaphorical \"plunge,\" which could refer to jumping into a pool or diving into something new. Given the visual setup, it implies a humorous and unexpected twist, as if the individuals are about to take a leap into a situation they are not prepared for due to their current predicament.\n\nConsidering the visual context and the intended humor, Caption B is more aligned with the visual gag and provides a more direct and humorous interpretation of the scene.\n\n<answer> B) So when are you two taking the plunge?? </answer>",

However, this is not immediately clear and might not be immediately humorous to most viewers.\n\n2. **Option B: \"Should we lock the doors?\"**\n   - This caption directly addresses the situation depicted in the image.

The caption suggests a concern about safety, which is a relatable and immediate worry for many people. It's a straightforward and humorous observation that people can easily relate to and find amusing.\n\nGiven these analyses, the second option, \"Should we lock the doors?\", is more likely to be considered funnier because it directly addresses the visual cue of the open windows and doors, which creates a sense of vulnerability and humor.\n</think>\n<answer>\nB) Should we lock the doors?\n</answer>",

The phrase \"what bees?\" adds a playful and slightly confused tone, suggesting surprise and amusement.\n\n2. **Option B: \"Are you interested in a timeshare here?\"**\n   - This caption introduces the concept of a timeshare, which is an unusual and somewhat absurd idea when applied to a tree.

It seems out of place and doesn't add any humor or relevance to the scene.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"I wish we'd noticed that before eating Bob.\"**\n   - This caption is a play on words. The word \"Bob\" is a reference to the UFO-like object floating in the water, which looks like it has candy and other items on top, resembling a dessert. The phrase \"eating Bob\" is a pun, implying that the object might be a food item, and the person is suggesting they should have realized this before consuming it.

The phrase \"please do not judge us by our covers\" is a common saying that implies judging someone based on their appearance rather than their character or actions. In this context, it humorously suggests that the books are not to be judged by their physical appearance (the cover), but perhaps by their content or the stories they contain.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"Normally, I like when books come to life.\"**\n   - This caption directly addresses the theme of the cartoon where the books are indeed coming to life. It's a straightforward statement that acknowledges the unusual situation depicted in the image. While it's clear and relevant, it doesn't add the layer of irony or humor that the first caption does by playing on the saying about judging appearances.\n\nConsidering the humor in the captions:\n- Caption A introduces an element of irony and social commentary through the saying, making it more playful and thought-provoking.\n- Caption B is more literal and straightforward, lacking the additional layer of humor provided by the saying.\n\nTherefore, the funnier caption is the one that adds more depth and humor through the use of a well-known saying.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is A: \"Please do not judge us by our covers.\"\n</answer>",

The caption might be seen as somewhat disconnected from the visual joke.\n\n- Option B: \"Mind the whale, dear.\"\n  - This caption directly addresses the situation depicted in the image.

The caption plays on the idea that the elephant is so large and obvious that it's not worth mentioning, which adds a layer of irony.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"Could you please lean a little less to the right?\"**\n   - This caption is a literal request for the man to adjust his posture.

The humor here comes from the idea of the cat being caught in an embarrassing or amusing situation and then shared publicly. It plays on the common fear of cats being caught in awkward or humorous situations.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"Thank goodness they will never really understand our power.\"**\n   - This caption implies that the cat is somehow powerful and that the person will be grateful if the cat doesn't realize its power. The humor here is more abstract and could be interpreted as the cat feeling superior or having some form of hidden power over the person. However, it lacks the immediate, relatable scenario that the first caption provides.\n\nConsidering the visual context of the cartoon, where the cat is sitting confidently on the counter and the person appears to be reaching for something, the first caption fits better with the scenario of the cat potentially being caught in a funny moment and then shared online. The second caption, while clever, doesn't directly relate to the visual elements of the cartoon as clearly.\n\nTherefore, the first caption is more likely to be considered funnier.\n</think>\n<answer>\nA) Now it is I who will post videos of you on the internet.\n</answer>",

It suggests that the marriage counselor and their client are not taking sides in the situation depicted. The humor in this caption would be subtle and might rely on the viewer interpreting the situation themselves.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"He was my first client.\"**\n   - This caption adds a layer of irony and humor. The person hanging from the ceiling is clearly not a typical client for a marriage counselor, and saying they were the \"first client\" implies a humorous exaggeration or absurdity. The caption plays on the unexpected nature of the situation, making it more likely to elicit a chuckle from viewers.\n\nGiven these analyses, the second caption introduces an element of absurdity and irony that makes it more likely to be considered funny by most people.\n</think>\n<answer>\nB) He was my first client.\n</answer>",

The humor comes from the unexpected twist that the board members are not human but instead appear to be various animals, which adds an absurd and humorous element.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"All in favor, say 'Arrrrg.'\"**\n   - This caption is a pun on the phrase \"All in favor, say 'aye.'\" It's a common way to vote in meetings, and the use of \"Arrrrg\" instead of \"aye\" is a playful twist that fits well with the animal theme of the cartoon. The humor here is more straightforward and relies on the wordplay rather than the context of gender imbalance.\n\nConsidering both captions:\n- Caption A introduces a new layer of humor by pointing out the gender imbalance in a non-human context, which can be seen as clever and unexpected.\n- Caption B is a simple pun that works well within the context of the cartoon but doesn't add the same level of surprise or depth as Caption A.\n\nGiven these points, Caption A seems to be funnier because it combines the humor of the gender imbalance with the absurdity of the animal characters, making it more impactful and unexpected.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is A: \"So the board still has no women?\"\n</answer>",

The phrase \"we are all going down\" could be interpreted as a reference to the elevator, but it doesn't directly relate to the space theme or the spacesuit.\n   - The humor here might be subtle and could be seen as a play on words, but it doesn't have a clear connection to the visual elements of the cartoon.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"Thank you, Hal, for opening the pod bay doors.\"**\n   - The image features a person in a spacesuit inside an elevator, which is reminiscent of the iconic scene from the movie \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" where the character Dave Bowman enters the pod bay doors.\n   - The phrase \"Thank you, Hal, for opening the pod bay doors\" directly references this famous scene, making a clear and humorous connection to the visual elements of the cartoon.\n   - The use of \"Hal\" is a direct nod to the AI computer from the movie, adding a layer of pop culture reference that enhances the humor.\n\nGiven these points, the second caption (B) is more likely to be considered funnier because it directly references a well-known cultural reference and ties it seamlessly to the visual elements of the cartoon.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nB) Thank you, Hal, for opening the pod bay doors.\n</answer>",

The phrase \"By golly\" is an expression of enthusiasm or determination, implying that Detroit has overcome its previous struggles and is now thriving again.\n   - The cartoon shows a large mechanical arm lifting a car, which could symbolize the revitalization of the automotive industry, a key part of Detroit's economy.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"Cherries are optional.\"**\n   - This caption is more abstract and less directly related to the content of the cartoon.

The cartoon shows a tiger perched on top of a printer, which is an unusual and unexpected scenario. The caption implies that the person is used to the current system (paper documents) and is expressing a sentiment of nostalgia for it as they move towards a paperless office environment.

The humor comes from the implication that the person is not actually engaging in physical activity but is instead fantasizing about it. It's a subtle and somewhat risqué joke that relies on the viewer's understanding of the situation.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"Hon, I think I heard a knock at the habitation module portal.\"**\n   - This caption introduces an element of science fiction or futuristic setting, suggesting that the person is in a space habitat or a similar environment where there are \"habitation modules\" and \"portals.\" The humor here is more abstract and might require the viewer to understand the context of the cartoon, which appears to be a standard bedroom scene.

The phrase \"rabbit\" could be a metaphor for something that has been hidden or disappeared, and the request to \"put the jury back\" suggests a desire to avoid a trial or judgment.\n   - However, the caption is somewhat vague and doesn't directly relate to the visual elements of the cartoon, such as the top hat and the formal courtroom setting.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"I just made a guy disappear for twenty years. Can you do that?\"**\n   - This caption is more direct and specific. It references the visual element of the top hat, which resembles a magician's hat, suggesting that the person in the hat has performed a magic trick. The mention of making someone disappear for twenty years adds a humorous twist, implying a magical feat that defies normal legal processes.\n   - The caption is more engaging because it ties directly to the visual cues in the cartoon and adds an unexpected and amusing element to the courtroom scenario.\n\nGiven these points, the second caption is more likely to be considered funnier due to its direct reference to the visual elements and the humorous exaggeration of the situation.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is B: \"I just made a guy disappear for twenty years.

The phrase \"talks like an occupier\" and \"walks like an occupier\" is a humorous exaggeration, suggesting she is acting in a manner typical of an occupying force. This could be seen as a playful commentary on her behavior.\n\n2. **Option B: \"You know, I couldn't have done it without your mother.\"**\n   - This caption seems out of place in the context of the cartoon. It doesn't relate to the visual elements or the implied situation depicted.

It's a common scenario where passengers might feel the need to comment on the strictness of security measures, especially if they have had a recent experience or if it's a topic of general concern.\n   - The humor here could come from the exaggerated or over-the-top nature of the statement, as well as the relatability of the situation for many travelers.\n\n2. **Option B: \"I only bring clothes that I definitely need.\"**\n   - This caption is more about personal habits and preparation for a flight. It's a straightforward statement that doesn't necessarily involve any humorous elements unless there's an underlying joke about the person's extreme frugality or the absurdity of bringing only essential items.\n   - The humor in this case would depend on the reader's interpretation of the person's behavior, but it lacks the immediate relatability and potential for exaggeration found in Option A.\n\nGiven these considerations, the first option, \"Man, those security people are strict!\" has a broader appeal because it taps into a common and relatable experience for many people traveling, making it more likely to elicit a chuckle from a wider audience.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is A: \"Man, those security people are strict!\"\n</answer>",

The phrase \"Ever get that feeling you're being followed?\" is a common expression used when someone feels like they are being watched or pursued, often humorously. In this cartoon, it adds a layer of irony because the men in suits are not actually following the horsemen but are instead being led by them. This creates a humorous twist on the familiar expression.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"Well, on the other hand, there is no fee unless we win.\"**\n   - This caption introduces a new element that is not present in the cartoon. It suggests a business transaction or a condition for service, which is not relevant to the scene depicted. The phrase \"on the other hand\" implies a contrast or an alternative, but it doesn't fit the visual joke of the men being led by the horsemen. The mention of a \"fee\" and \"winning\" is out of place and doesn't enhance the humor of the situation.\n\nGiven these analyses, the first caption, \"Ever get that feeling you're being followed?\", is more fitting and humorous because it directly relates to the visual joke in the cartoon without introducing irrelevant elements.\n</think>\n<answer>\nA) Ever get that feeling you're being followed?\n</answer>",

The humor comes from the unexpected nature of the scenario.\n\n- Caption B: \"You beamed him up. You feed him.\"\n  - This caption directly references the action taking place in the cartoon, where the dog appears to be being transported into the spaceship. The phrase \"beamed him up\" is a nod to science fiction tropes, particularly from Star Trek, where characters are transported using a transporter. The second part, \"You feed him,\" adds a humorous twist by suggesting that the aliens need to take care of the dog, which is an anthropomorphic and unexpected element given the context.\n\nConsidering the elements of surprise, wordplay, and the unexpected nature of the situation, Caption B is more engaging and humorous because it directly addresses the visual gag and adds a playful twist by involving the dog in the scenario.\n\nFinal Answer: B) You beamed him up.

It's a common phrase used to indicate a moment of insight or understanding. However, in this cartoon, the dog appears to be in a state of confusion or contemplation, not necessarily having a moment of clarity. The caption might not align well with the visual humor of the cartoon.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"Any place you'd like me to lick for you?\"**\n   - This caption is a playful and humorous question directed at the dog.

In this context, it humorously suggests that the speaker is responding to an accusation about their mental state.\n   - The humor here is subtle and relies on wordplay, which can be appreciated by those who understand the reference but may not be immediately obvious to everyone.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"And I say you DO have room for 3 billion more people!?\"**\n   - This caption directly addresses the image where a small figure is standing at a podium in front of a giant globe. The implication is that the globe (representing Earth) has plenty of space for additional inhabitants.\n   - The humor here is more straightforward and relies on the absurdity of the situation: a tiny person suggesting that the entire planet has room for billions more people.

The phrase \"survived worse\" could be interpreted as a light-hearted acknowledgment of their ability to cope with adversity.\n\n2. **Option B: \"I'd like to see other people.\"**\n   - This caption introduces an element of isolation and perhaps a hint of loneliness.

The use of multiple question marks adds to the comedic effect by emphasizing surprise or confusion.\n\nGiven these observations, the second option, \"And your referral was from WHERE???\", is more likely to be considered funnier because it introduces an element of surprise and absurdity that contrasts sharply with the serious activity shown in the image.\n</think>\n<answer>\nB) And your referral was from WHERE???\n</answer>",

However, the setting and activity (fishing on ice) do not align with typical office environments, making this caption somewhat confusing and less humorous.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"The decoys don't seem to be working.\"**\n   - The cartoon shows two people fishing on ice with what appear to be shark fins sticking out of the holes. These \"decoys\" are likely meant to attract fish, but instead, they resemble sharks, which could be a humorous twist. The caption \"The decoys don't seem to be working\" plays on the idea that the \"decoys\" (shark fins) are not effective at attracting fish, adding a layer of irony and humor to the situation.\n\nGiven these analyses, the second caption is more aligned with the visual humor of the cartoon, as it directly addresses the unexpected and ironic nature of the \"decoys.\"\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is B: \"The decoys don't seem to be working.\"\n</answer>",

In the cartoon, the man on the couch has his shoes off, and there is no indication that he is preparing for an event like the Rapture. The caption could be interpreted as a humorous observation about the lack of preparation or the unexpectedness of the situation, but it doesn't directly relate to the visual elements of the cartoon.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"I downloaded a job app for you.\"**\n   - This caption suggests that someone has taken action (downloading a job app) to help the person sitting across from the therapist. However, the cartoon does not show any indication of job searching or the presence of a job app. The caption seems out of place and doesn't align with the visual narrative of the cartoon.\n\nGiven these analyses, neither caption perfectly fits the visual context of the cartoon. However, if we have to choose the funnier one based on the given options, **\"Guess we missed the Rapture.\"** is more likely to be considered funny because it makes a subtle reference to a well-known concept that can be humorously applied to the situation depicted in the cartoon.

In the context of the cartoon, it could be interpreted as the man on the left is reading a newspaper that is likely filled with the same financial news and headlines he has seen before. The woman on the right seems to be engaged in a conversation that might also be repetitive or mundane.\n   - The simplicity and relatability of this caption make it humorous because it captures a common scenario where there is little change or excitement.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"Wall Street's gonna love #10.\"**\n   - This caption introduces an element of sarcasm or irony. It suggests that whatever is being discussed (likely related to the newspaper content) is so mundane or uninteresting that even Wall Street professionals would find it boring. The use of \"#10\" implies that this is the tenth item in a list of such mundane topics, further emphasizing the lack of excitement.\n   - The humor here comes from the exaggeration and the implication that the topic is so uninteresting that it would be a relief for even those who typically deal with such matters.\n\nConsidering these points, both captions are funny but in different ways:\n- Caption A is funny due to its relatability and the mundane nature of the situation.\n- Caption B is funny due to its exaggeration and the implication of the topic's unimportance.\n\nHowever, if we consider the level of wit and the unexpected twist, Caption B might be considered more clever and humorous because it adds a layer of irony and sarcasm that Caption A lacks.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nB) Wall Street's gonna love #10.\n</answer>",

The humor here is more straightforward and relies on the obvious explanation of the sharks eating the bait.

The word \"proof\" is used humorously to refer to the woman's body shape, suggesting that her figure is a form of evidence for the effectiveness of Pilates. It's a clever and light-hearted way to comment on the visual joke in the cartoon.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"It's just not funny if she looks so sexy.\"**\n   - This caption directly addresses the visual element of the cartoon. It suggests that the humor lies in the contrast between the编辑 (editor) and the woman's appearance. The use of \"sexy\" adds an unexpected twist, making it more provocative and potentially humorous in its own way.\n\nBoth captions are humorous, but they approach the humor differently:\n- Caption A uses a pun to make a light-hearted observation.\n- Caption B uses a direct statement about the visual elements to create a more provocative and possibly controversial humor.\n\nGiven the nature of the cartoon contest, where humor can be subjective and often depends on the audience's interpretation, both could be considered funny.

The image depicts a group of people walking past a store window, with one woman talking on her phone and another man looking at the window. There's no direct connection to the captions provided, but we can infer that the captions might be related to the theme of work or business.\n\n2. Caption A: \"I have to go to Central Park to extend the maturity date on a life insurance policy a couple of thousand years.\"\n   - This caption is absurd and nonsensical. It doesn't make logical sense to extend a life insurance policy for thousands of years, especially not in Central Park. The humor here comes from the absurdity and the impossibility of the situation.\n\n3. Caption B: \"Oh, sure, they find one secretary in a pool of her own blood and everybody wants to blame the werewolf.\"\n   - This caption is also absurd and nonsensical. It introduces a dramatic and supernatural scenario (a secretary in a pool of her own blood and blaming it on a werewolf) without any apparent connection to the image. The humor here is more in the absurdity of the situation rather than a logical or situational joke.\n\nBoth captions are humorous due to their absurdity, but they differ in their approach:\n- Caption A focuses on an impossible task in a mundane setting.\n- Caption B introduces a dramatic and supernatural scenario.\n\nGiven the context of the image and the captions, neither directly relates to the scene depicted. However, if we were to choose based on the absurdity and the unexpectedness of the situation, both could be considered funny in their own way. \n\nSince the question asks which is funnier, and considering the captions' ability to surprise and amuse, both could be seen as equally funny in different contexts.

They give me this stuff every day and it hasn't killed me yet.\"**\n   - This caption suggests that the animal character is reassuring the human character about the safety of the medication or treatment they are discussing. The humor here comes from the unexpected nature of the character (an animal in a lab coat), which adds an element of absurdity. However, the reassurance might come across as slightly patronizing or condescending.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"I take this myself.

It also introduces a sense of vulnerability and honesty, which can make the joke more impactful.\n\nConsidering these points, the second caption (B) is likely to be perceived as funnier because it directly addresses the viewer's curiosity about the medication and introduces a personal touch that makes the joke more relatable and engaging.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is B: \"I take this myself.

The phrase \"rope you in\" is a colloquial expression that suggests being tricked or coerced into something, which fits well with the visual gag of being tied up at what looks like a social gathering.

The caption does not align well with the visual humor of the cartoon, making it less funny.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"He'll be pissed when he realizes he forgot the Kingsford.\"**\n   - This caption references the brand of charcoal briquettes used for grilling, which is a common item used in outdoor activities like golfing.

It suggests a transformation and humorously implies that the character has become much larger and more imposing.\n   - The use of \"remember\" adds a nostalgic element, which can be endearing or amusing depending on how it's interpreted.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"If I can make it here, I'll make it anywhere!\"?**\n   - This caption is a quote from the movie \"The Wizard of Oz,\" where Dorothy says this after landing in Kansas.

While it might be true, it lacks the unexpected twist or cultural reference that adds humor to Option A.\n   - The humor in this case would be more situational and less universally relatable compared to the historical and financial contrast in Option A.\n\nGiven these analyses, the first option, \"Remember the Alamo—now, that was a foreclosure!\" is more likely to be considered funnier because it combines a historical reference with a modern financial term in a way that creates an unexpected and humorous contrast.\n</think>\n<answer>\nA) Remember the Alamo—now, that was a foreclosure!\n</answer>",

    "prediction": "<think>\nTo determine which caption is funnier, let's analyze each option in the context of the cartoon:\n\n1. **Option A: \"Re-occupy Wall Street.\"**\n   - This caption is a reference to the Occupy Wall Street movement, which was a series of protests that began in 2011. The caption is serious and political, and it doesn't align well with the casual and somewhat absurd scenario depicted in the cartoon. The cartoon shows a man in a suit sitting on a couch with his shoes off, while another man is sitting across from him with a dog and some cans. There's no clear connection to the Occupy Wall Street movement.\n\n2. **Option B: \"Should I call you Babar???\"**\n   - This caption is a playful and humorous reference to the character Babar, who is a fictional elephant king from children's literature. The caption suggests a whimsical interaction where one person is playfully asking if they should address someone as Babar. This fits well with the cartoon's tone, which seems to be light-hearted and absurd. The presence of the dog and the casual setting also support this interpretation.\n\nGiven these analyses, the caption that aligns better with the cartoon's tone and humor is Option B: \"Should I call you Babar???\"\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nB) Should I call you Babar???\n</answer>",

    "prediction": "<think>\nTo determine which caption is funnier, let's analyze each option in the context of the cartoon.\n\n1. The cartoon depicts an elephant in a room where two people are seated at a table, seemingly engaged in a serious discussion. The elephant's presence is significant and humorous because it is unexpected and large, suggesting something unusual or out of place.\n\n2. Caption A: \"I don't have any idea what you're talking about.\"\n   - This caption is neutral and doesn't add any humor to the situation. It simply expresses confusion without any context that relates to the cartoon.\n\n3. Caption B: \"We're seeing the end of the Republican party.\"\n   - This caption introduces a political context (the Republican party) that is not directly related to the cartoon. While it might be a clever play on words given the elephant (often used as a metaphor for a large problem), it lacks the immediate relevance and humor that the cartoon itself provides.\n\nGiven these points, the funnier caption would be the one that aligns more closely with the visual and thematic elements of the cartoon. Since the cartoon is a New Yorker cartoon, it often uses visual humor rather than wordplay.\n\nTherefore, the funnier caption is:\n</think>\n<answer>A) I don't have any idea what you're talking about.</answer>",

    "prediction": "<think>\nTo determine which caption is funnier, let's analyze each one:\n\n1. **Caption A: \"Only you will truly know when your table is ready.\"**\n   - This caption implies that the person sitting at the table is in control and can decide when they are ready to be served. It's somewhat ambiguous and doesn't immediately convey a humorous situation.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"I'm sorry, we're booked several lifetimes in advance.\"**\n   - This caption directly addresses the absurdity of the situation where the person is waiting for a table that is reserved for an extremely long time. The humor comes from the exaggerated nature of the booking duration, which is not something one would typically expect in a restaurant setting. The phrase \"several lifetimes\" adds a layer of absurdity and humor that makes it more relatable and funny to the audience.\n\nGiven this analysis, the second caption is more likely to be considered funnier due to its direct and exaggerated humor.\n</think>\n<answer>\nB) I'm sorry, we're booked several lifetimes in advance.\n</answer>",

Other people do have to testify after you.\"**\n   - This caption is formal and somewhat serious, suggesting that the person in the hot tub is being asked to testify in a legal or official setting. The humor here might come from the absurdity of someone in a hot tub being called to testify, but it doesn't play on any obvious puns or unexpected situations.\n\n2. **Caption B: \"If your shorts are off, why is your phone still vibrating?\"**\n   - This caption is more casual and playful. It plays on the visual gag of the person in the hot tub wearing shorts, which is unusual for such an environment. The question about the phone vibrating adds an element of surprise and absurdity, making it more likely to elicit a chuckle from viewers.\n\nGiven these points, the second caption uses a more relatable and humorous scenario that plays on the unexpectedness of the situation, making it more likely to be considered funny by most people.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is B: \"If your shorts are off, why is your phone still vibrating?\"\n</answer>",

The humor here might be in the absurdity of the request, as it seems out of place in such a formal environment.\n   \n2. **Caption B: \"Is this what they mean about making art come alive???\"**\n   - This caption plays on the idea that the artwork itself is coming to life, which is a common theme in cartoons where objects or characters in paintings or sculptures seem to move or interact. The humor here is more subtle and relies on the viewer's understanding of the concept of \"making art come alive.\"\n\nConsidering these points:\n- Caption A is more straightforward and relies on the incongruity of the request in the context of an art gallery.\n- Caption B is more abstract and requires the viewer to interpret the artwork in a specific way, which can be seen as clever but less immediately humorous.\n\nGiven the nature of the contest and the typical audience appreciation for direct humor over abstract concepts, **Caption A** is likely to be considered funnier because it provides a clear and immediate point of amusement through the absurdity of the request.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is A: \"Please, a sandwich, a piece of fruit, anything.\"\n</answer>",

The image shows a group of people in a cave-like setting, with one person pointing at something in the sky, possibly birds or a celestial event. The caption implies a reflective or self-reflective tone, which might not be immediately humorous to everyone.\n   \n2. **Caption B: \"I tell you, I just didn't see this coming.\"**\n   - This caption implies surprise or disbelief at an unexpected event. It's a common expression used when someone is caught off guard by something they did not anticipate. The image itself doesn't show any immediate sign of surprise or an unexpected event, but the caption could be interpreted as a reaction to the scene if it were to suddenly change or reveal something surprising.\n\nGiven that the image does not inherently suggest a moment of surprise or an unexpected event, the second caption might feel more out of place and less relevant to the scene. On the other hand, the first caption, while not directly related to the image, introduces a layer of self-reflection that can be seen as a humorous twist, especially if the viewer interprets the scene as a metaphor for storytelling or personal narratives.\n\nHowever, the second caption, \"I tell you, I just didn't see this coming,\" is more straightforward and could be considered more universally relatable as a reaction to an unexpected situation, even though it doesn't fit the image perfectly.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe funnier caption is likely to be:\n\nB) \"I tell you, I just didn't see this coming.\"\n\nThis is because it provides a relatable and immediate reaction to the scene, even though it doesn't directly relate to the image.

However, it lacks humor and doesn't play on any unexpected or absurd elements of the scene.\n\n2. **Option B: \"And you said you'd never tell.\"**\n   - This caption introduces an element of surprise and irony. The dinosaur, being a prehistoric creature, is at a modern book signing event, which is an unusual and humorous scenario. The phrase \"And you said you'd never tell\" implies that someone (likely the author or another character not shown in the image) had previously promised to keep something secret but now has revealed it, adding a layer of unexpectedness and humor.\n\nGiven these analyses, Option B introduces a more playful and ironic twist that aligns well with the absurdity of the cartoon, making it funnier.\n</think>\n<answer>\nB) And you said you'd never tell.\n</answer>",
