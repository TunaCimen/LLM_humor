    "chosen_by_llm": "Earl of Cowlick. And you are?",
    "correct": true,
    "reason": "This caption cleverly plays on the word 'cowlick' to create a humorous persona, making it witty and lighthearted.

    "challenger": "Is my intent showing?",
    "chosen_by_llm": "First day on Wall Street, sir?",
    "correct": true,

    "correct": true,
    "reason": "This caption is a clever wordplay on the stereotype of gym-goers facing their fears or challenges as if they're confronting a grim figure.

    "chosen_by_llm": "Of course it\u2019s hot. It\u2019s stollen.",
    "correct": false,

    "correct": true,
    "reason": "This caption is funnier because it presents a whimsical and absurd scenario involving a 'loaner corn dog,' which is unexpected and humorous. The play on words with 'drive a stick' adds a layer of comedic confusion, making it more entertaining than the frustration expressed in Candidate B's caption."

    "chosen_by_llm": "Lunch is on me.",
    "correct": true,

    "chosen_by_llm": "Is the salmon fresh?",

    "chosen_by_llm": "Hold on, the Senate Committee on Women's Health is getting out.",
    "correct": true,
    "reason": "Candidate A humorously plays on the idea of a Senate committee being a place where serious discussions can lead to comedic misunderstandings, especially regarding women's health, which can be a sensitive topic. The absurdity of a committee 'getting out' suggests a ridiculous or unexpected scenario in a serious context, making it more layered and socially relevant compared to Candidate B's straightforward pun about a resume typo."

    "reason": "This caption uses absurdity and surreal imagery to evoke humor, suggesting a ridiculous future reality about judges.
